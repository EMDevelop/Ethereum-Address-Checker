## Ethereum Wallet Address Checker

This script takes an input of 2 or more Ethereum Addresses and tells you:

- [Level 1] Whether any of your input addresses have transacted (to or from) with eachother
- [Level 2] Whether any of your input addresses have any addresses in common that they have transacted with (to or from).

## How To Use


## Working on features
- Automate the red_herrings list, aka, addresss that are token contracts, exchanges, aka not normal wallets + exclude them from results
- [Level 3] using all transactions (from and to) input addresses, for each address find their own transactions, log if any similar addresses come up



## Notes

- Built using Ruby
- Only works with Ethereum addresses
